DATA VALIDATION AND DATA INSERTION

For data to be valid and accurate you should consider the following factors

â€¢ Vehicles are allocated to the different outlets of Xcellent Rental.

â€¢ Vehicles at all outlets must have similar details.

â€¢ Rental prices are the same for vehicles of the same year, make and model.

Although we can enforce business rules, the complexity and scope of assessment will increase. To keep within scope, data validity is left to you to ensure correctness. It is important that data is correct and accurate to perform the querying part of the assessment. In addition, the following applies to data insertion:

QUERYING AND REPORTING

Rob Stark has requested the following reports (queries). Please use CSV format for the queries.

TASKS TO COMPLETE

Your task is to develop a database solution for Xcellent Rental Hamilton using SQL Developer. The Moodle website include several examples to help you develop the solution. A following list of tasks should be completed:

TIPS AND IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

This project encourages you to make reasonable choices. There is no â€˜one wayâ€™ to implement this solution. Furthermore, it is important that you have a long-term plan to develop and test components step by step. In the following, one approach to develop this application is presented which includes tips and guidelines.

1. The best start is to understand the requirements and the big picture. Read this document a few times and identify the components and the required skills to implement this application. It is a good idea to have a high-level design and a plan to implement this project.

2. Get familiar with using the software and how to generate solutions

3. Itis important to know how to use Oracle Data Modeller to create DDL scripts, how to modify the scripts, and then run them in SQL Developer. Go to Moodle and complete the relevant activities which are very close to what you need for this project. Pay attention to how these examples show you how to develop the solution.

4. When the physical database has been created you will need to insert data into the relevant tables. Start by inserting data into Parent Tables, then insert data into child tables understanding that you need to use existing primary key values from parent tables. Get familiar with INSERT SELECT to help with extracting values from existing parent tables and INSERT UPDATE to update values in associated tables.

5. You will need to query your databases to be familiar with what data has been stored in your database.
